#### Day 1 - Fri 10/7 - Florence
## **Exploring the Historic Town Centre**

After checking into our AirBnB, we fed our famished selves at [Ristorante Dante e Beatrice](https://dantebeatrice.com/) before stepping out to walk around the Town Centre on our seventeenth wind to walk around the Duomo. 

We scouted the way to Accademia on our way over to the Piazza della Santissma Annunziata, rewarding ourselves with our first Florentine gelato at [La Strega Nocciola](https://www.lastreganocciola.it/).  

We then walked down the Via Calzaiuoli to the Piazza della Signoria, with its many statues, ducking into the magnificent courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio.
