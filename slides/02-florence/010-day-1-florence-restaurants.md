#### Day 1 - Fri 10/7 - Florence 
## **Food & Shopping**

> If you're hungry, there are many options near the AirBnB including: <br>
> - [**Caffeteria della Oblate**](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d2433470-Reviews-Caffetteria_delle_Oblate-Florence_Tuscany.html), a laid-back budget eatery a block from the Duomo within a library, known more for its outdoor terrace and a bright interior with views of the Duomo, than the food, which is basic but affordable.
> - [**Mercato Centrale**](https://www.mercatocentrale.com/florence/how-it-works/) The better food vendor stalls downstairs close at 3PM, but upstairs there is a more touristy food court.

<br>

> - [**San Lorenzo Market**](https://www.visitflorence.com/what-to-do-in-florence/shopping/san-lorenzo-central-market.html) If you're itching to start shopping, step outside the Mercato Centrale and you'll find vendor stalls hawking all kinds of leather goods.  Be sure to negotiate to get the best price!

<br>

> We'll grab fresh food to bring back to the AirBnB for tomorrow's breakfast before our busy sightseeing day in Florence!
