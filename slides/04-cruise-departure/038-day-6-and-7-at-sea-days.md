#### Day 6 and 7 - Tue 10/12, Wed 10/13 - Cruise Days 2 and 3
## **Days at Sea**

These are the days to have laundry done, and take advantage of the amenities on the Pride.  <br> Here's just a couple of the many options included with the cruise.

### Activities
#### [Waterworks](https://www.carnival.com/onboard/waterworks)
Want to make a splash on deck? Grab your trunks and flip-flops and head to the upper deck to the onboard water park.

### Food
#### [Guy's Burger Joint](https://www.carnival.com/cruise-food/guys-burger-joint)
If you're itching to have a burger, Guy Fieri's namesake restaurant, is open for lunch only from Noon to just before 6:00 daily.  Hitting while we don't have a shore excursion might be the best option.

#### [BlueIguana Cantina](https://www.carnival.com/cruise-food/blueiguana-cantina)
Have a burrito or taco made fresh your way, for breakfast or lunch.  Rock out with your guac out!
