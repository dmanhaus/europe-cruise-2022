#### Day 3/4 - Sun 10/9 & Mon 10/10 - Rome
## **Rapid Test at Pharmacy**

This is our backup option, in case anything goes wrong with the proctored self-test.

#### When we test in Rome

* We take rapid antigen tests in the [Farmacia Amerula](https://www.farmaciamerulana.it/) first thing on Monday morning.  The pharmacy is [directly across the street from our AirBnB](https://goo.gl/maps/r74PguPdA7wb2yhi8). 
* The pharmacy is closed on Sunday, open Monday & Tuesday from 8:00 AM until 6:00 PM.
* Depending on how quickly they process the results, we can either: 
  * wait for the results at the pharmacy immediately after we test 
  * take the test and then find breakfast nearby and come back afterwards to pick up the results
  * come back later that day, before **6:00 PM** <span style="font-size:65%">(unlikely, due to our timed entry at the Colosseum)</span>
  * come back Tuesday morning at **8:00 AM**, before we check out of the airbnb to leave for Civitavecchia

> I have not verfied that the pharmacy is offering rapid tests, how much it costs, or how quickly the results are available.  I sent an email to the pharmacy, but may not receive a response.
