> 138 steps lead sharply up from the "Sinking Boat Fountain", built by Bernini's father, Pietro, in the Piazza di Spagna. This fountain is fed by the same ancient aqueduct, the Acqua Vergine, that supplies the Trevi Fountain.<br>
> Partway up, the steps fan out around a central terrace, forming a butterfly shape.
> An obelisk, framed by two Baroque church towers, stands at the top.
