#### Day 3 - Sun 10/9 - Rome
## **Spanish Steps**

<span style="font-size:80%">ðŸš¶**6:30**: Walk from Trevi Fountain to the Spanish Steps [(8 mins)](https://goo.gl/maps/MKdDinjuN6Tthqzu7)</span>

> 138 steps lead sharply up from the "Sinking Boat Fountain", built by Bernini's father, Pietro, in the Piazza di Spagna. This fountain is fed by the same ancient aqueduct, the Acqua Vergine, that supplies the Trevi Fountain.<br>
> Partway up, the steps fan out around a central terrace, forming a butterfly shape.
> An obelisk, framed by two Baroque church towers, stands at the top.

This is where our touring for the day ends.  We'll find a dinner spot in the neighborhood before returning to our AirBnB for a well earned rest.

>Enjoy the steps, but whatever you do, don't sit down on them, or it'll cost you a **â‚¬250 fine** (seriously).
