#### Day 3/4 - Sun 10/9 & Mon 10/10 - Rome
## **COVID Testing Options**

<span style="font-size:75%">At this time, there are three scenarios, any of which may play out:</span>

| Proctored Self-test at AirBnB | Rapid Test at Pharmacy | No Test Required |
| --- | --- | --- |  
| **Sunday Night**: <br> <span style="font-size:65%">We take [self-administered tests](https://store.emed.com/s/category/covid19-athome-test-with-verified-lab-report-emed/0ZG8c000000LZXk?c__results_layout_state=%7B%7D), proctored [virtually](https://www.emed.com/airline-travel?gclid=Cj0KCQjw1bqZBhDXARIsANTjCPIgSenPhfLzVwm8rLhfNMH4pTaQXq9Iv7SFi4M0CfyGEaDHKPFXpxMaAritEALw_wcB) at the AirBnB, anytime after check-in</span> <span style="font-size:50%"> </span>| **Monday Morning**: <br> <span style="font-size:65%">We take rapid antigen tests in a [pharmacy](https://www.farmaciamerulana.it/) across the street from our AirBnB on Monday morning, before we begin our day, and pick up the results sometime before we leave Rome on Tuesday morning</span> | <span style="font-size:65%">**IF** Greece relaxes restrictions requiring COVID testing to enter Greek ports, and the cruise line follows suit before we depart, we'll skip testing, but we need to plan ahead to test so we're not refused to board at port</span> |

> <span style="font-size:75%">Testing **is not available at the port** through Carnival, and those who arrive at port without a test result will be **denied** boarding.</span>

><span style="font-size:75%">If one person in a cabin tests postive, **both persons** occupying that cabin will be **denied** boarding, but the rest of our group can board if they test negative.</span>
