#### Day 4 - Mon 10/10 - Rome
## **St Peter's Square and Basilica**

<br>

#### St. Peter's Square

> 284 Doric-style columns, each 56 feet high, topped with 140 statues of saints, each one 10 feet tall.
> Bernini designed this square, which is really an ellipse that's roughly the same dimensions as the Colosseum. <br>
> A 2,000 year old, 90 foot, solid granite obelisk stands in the center, moved by the emperor Caligula from Egypt to Rome in ancient times. 

<br>

#### St. Peter's Basilica

> Once you've seen the square, its time to set foot inside the richest and grandest church on Earth.  Michelangelo's **Pieta** sits behind bulletproof glass just to the right of the entrance.

<span style="font-size:50%">**Dress Code**: No shorts, above-the-knee skirts, or bare shoulders allowed in the Basilica (enforced).</span>
