#### Day 3/4 - Sun 10/9 & Mon 10/10 - Rome
## **Proctored Self-test at AirBnB - eMed/Navica App**

This is our preferred option.  

#### **Before We Leave Home**

* We purchase eight tests in advance directly from [eMed](https://store.emed.com/s/category/covid19-athome-test-with-verified-lab-report-emed/0ZG8c000000LZXk?c__results_layout_state=%7B%7D)<br>
Tests cost **$150** for a six-pack, and **$70** for a two-pack, plus **$20** for standard overnight shipping, for a total of **$240** for the group.

* We download the Navica app, which is preferred by Carnival at check-in, and upload our proof of vaccination **before we leave** for the trip <br>
