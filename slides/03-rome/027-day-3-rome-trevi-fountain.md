#### Day 3 - Sun 10/9 - Rome
## **Trevi Fountain**

ðŸ“· **6:00 (approximate)**: Arrive at the Trevi Fountain

> Trevi Fountain, designed by architect Nicola Salvi in 1762, cleverly incorporates the palace behind the fountain into the scene as a backdrop.

<br>

> We'll see the Trevi Fountain twice today. Once during the "golden hour", illuminated  by the setting sun, and a second time after dark, lit up with lights, on our way back to the AirBnB after dinner.  

<br>

> If you want to skip the previous parts of this walk, and do something else for the afternoon, **6:00 PM** is the time we should all meet up, before we head on to the Spanish Steps.
