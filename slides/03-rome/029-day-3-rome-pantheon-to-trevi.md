> Walking from the Pantheon towards the Trevi Fountain, we'll pass through the Piazza di Montecitorio, home to the Italian Parliament, marked by an Egyptian obelisk from the 6th century BC, brought home by Emperor Augustus as a trophy of his victory over Mark Anthony and Cleopatra.

> One block further brings us to the Piazza Colonna, home to a massive column, 12 feet across and almost 100 feet tall, that has stood since the 2nd century AD.  This column tells the story of Emperor Marcus Aurellius fighting the Barbarians around 170 AD.
