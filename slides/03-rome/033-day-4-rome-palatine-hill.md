#### Day 4 - Mon 10/10 - Rome
## **Palatine Hill**

> Humans first settled on the Palatine Hill in the 10th century BC: 200 years before Romulus founded Rome. Throughout the Roman Republic and Roman Empire, it was continuously inhabited: first by Rome’s most eminent residents, incluing Romulus himself, later by the city’s succession of Caesars.

<br>

> Today, only the barest skeleton remains to tell the story of this, the "Beverly Hills" of the ancient world. in addition to providing an excellent vantage point for viewing the entire Forum.
